A framework independent 3D Level editor (in development)

This level editor is developed because of the lack of a framework independent 3d level editor which can be implemented into every game engine or framework. For 2D games there already is one, [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org), but for 3D I could only find some which are not in development anymore. So I came to the conclusion to program my own.

## Features
+ Loading of 3D Models (.obj)
+ Translating, Scaling, Rotating (soon)
+ Save level to xml format (soon)
+ Adding of lights (soon)

## Dependencies
[GoHomeEngine](https://github.com/PucklaMotzer09/GoHomeEngine)
